 # Re-evaluating Metamorphic Testing of Chess Engines: A Replication Study

Our work reproduced the original study "Metamorphic Testing of Chess Engines" published at [IST journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584923001179).
We also replicated it while varying three factors, namely: 1) the depth value; 2) the dataset through the inclusion of realistic positions; and 3) the version of Stockfish.
We found that the metamorphic relations are not as effective as in the original article, especially on realistic chess positions and increase of depth (original depth=10 was too low).
We raise awareness of the sensitivity of depth: metamorphic relations may only be violated at specific depths, and there is a depth threshold beyond which the testing method becomes ineffective.
Through a rigorous and in-depth analysis of the source code, we found  why Stockfish can exhibit discrepancies on transformed positions and why at certain low depths, metamorphic relations are not effective.
Our overall conclusion is that it is not a bug, but a feature of the exploration process of modern chess engines.

 This repository contains:
 * all data (Stockfish analysis of all positions at different depth, with different version, and on transformations),
 * instructions to reproduce experiments,
 * scripts used to analyze data,
 * heatmaps and results integrated in notebooks.


## Notebook and analysis scripts

See `data-notebook-results/reevaluating-SF-MT.ipynb` for the analysis and results.
There are several sections and subsections in the Notebook, and the overall organization is as follows:
 * utility fucntions for importing data and to transform positions
 * results with Stockfish 15 at depth=10, depth=15, and depth=20 on `mirror, sim_axis, sim_diag, better, first` transformations, using original dataset as well as our dataset (based on Lichess)
  - results of Section 4 can be traced back here (depth=10)
  - results of Section 5.1 and 5.2 can be traced back here
 * analysis on biggest gaps using larger depth (eg depth=30)
 * experiments on the Carlsen-Nepo game (Stockfish 15 and 16)
 * results with Stockfish 16 at depth=10 and depth=20 on `mirror, sim_axis, sim_diag, better, first` transformationsn,  using original dataset as well as our dataset (based on Lichess)
  - results of Section 5.3 can be traced back here

The notebook relies on Stockfish (you should edit the absolute path) as well as the data (see below for more information).
A PDF of all results is also available in the `data-notebook-results` folder.


## Stockfish source code analysis

We performed a rigorous and in-depth analysis of the Stockfish source code.
Hence resuls of Section 6 can be traced back here.
We found why Stockfish can exhibit discrepancies on transformed positions and why at certain low depths, metamorphic relations are not effective.
See folder `Stockfish_code_analysis` that contains specific instructions to reproduce the analysis.
